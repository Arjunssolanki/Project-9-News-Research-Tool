# Project-9 News Research Tool
 This tool is built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging Google's Generative AI model Gemini-PRO. It fetches the content from a news article URL, processes it to create a searchable vector store, and generates accurate answers to user queries. This advanced approach ensures high-quality, contextually relevant responses for an efficient and effective user experience.
### How It Works

Follow these simple steps to interact with the tool:

1. **Enter Your API Keys**: You'll need Google and News API keys for the tool to access Google's Generative AI models and fetch news articles. Obtain your API keys [Google](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/register).

2. **Enter News URL or Search Query**: Provide the URL of a news article to fetch and analyze its content or use a search query to find relevant news articles.

3. **Ask a Question**: After processing the article, ask any question related to the content for a precise answer.
